		 * Class name of the used ExtJS product tag controller implementation
		 *
		 * Each default ExtJS controller can be replace by an alternative imlementation.
		 * To use this implementation, you have to set the last part of the class
		 * name as configuration value so the client factory knows which class it
		 * has to instantiate.
		 *
		 * For example, if the name of the default class is
		 *
		 *  \Aimeos\Controller\ExtJS\Product\Tag\Standard
		 *
		 * and you want to replace it with your own version named
		 *
		 *  \Aimeos\Controller\ExtJS\Product\Tag\Mytag
		 *
		 * then you have to set the this configuration option:
		 *
		 *  controller/extjs/product/tag/name = Mytag
		 *
		 * The value is the last part of your own class name and it's case sensitive,
		 * so take care that the configuration value is exactly named like the last
		 * part of the class name.
		 *
		 * The allowed characters of the class name are A-Z, a-z and 0-9. No other
		 * characters are possible! You should always start the last part of the class
		 * name with an upper case character and continue only with lower case characters
		 * or numbers. Avoid chamel case names like "MyTag"!
